*Last night I made a vow not to touch the lines.*

*A day before I was tied to a thread, a life.*

*And tomorrow might be the day I grow old.*

*But today shan't pass , a day I sing your praises.*
<!--more-->
<br>

*I don't sing a fancy of omnipotence!*

*Neither do I not say nay, when omniscience shows marvel!*

*But when a mortal weeps....*

*Maybe when she endure patriarchy to have you old!*

*Or when her urethra creaks as you stiff your tiny head*

*to walk the Earth...*

<br>

*Let's sing the song of mortality !*

*Let the mage of the south beats upon the lushes..*

*On this day,*

*between the legs of oppressive patriarchs lays their egotistical bowl of manliness!*

<br>

*And even the doublet scrotum takes a break of solitude!*

*To praise a mortal whose pain shine and shield forth life!*

*To hail a mortal whose tears pounds off infirmities*

*And whose love kills all ills.....*

<br>

*If I hadn't live last night , through her!*

*The day after wouldn't be the day I change the world!*

*If I hadn't walk to school in her heels*

*Tomorrow wouldn't even worth the thirst!*

<br>

*If I have promised the sea not to write it's peaceful praise again!*

*Forgive me o! Principality and honour my gem in their precious affinity !*

*On that day with a blank vista that always open to life!*

*She sat down besides me as I lay hibiscus on my father's grave ...*

*With my face buried deep into her Bossom!*

*Her love never makes me feel a trifle of loss!*

*If I and you would one day be the world !*

*Then, shouldn't today praise our mother than a saviour in the sky!*
