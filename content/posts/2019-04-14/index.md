*Sunny traverse on a river bank! My legs yet sours*

*Sunscreens , battered , taciturn , body , wind laps*

*Follicle swerves; undulates! Spine gently rusks!*
<br>

*Golden rays on a sunny beach, the sun is yet to dusk!*

*Wiggle ! In the crowd, rotund waist; shroud like hamster!*

*Recherch√© bikini! Doused in carribean swagger!*

*Behold! Sophistication! She kills the sight of men!*

<br>

*She is a repertoire of nature's skillful*

*When she took the dance! Habits of mastery she dabbles!*

*Sousing her sassy waist; left or right!! Query not! my eyes!*

*Neat pupils, a galaxy of expressions ; her charm! A tilt of fecundity!!*

*In lust it enchant men; blind , tiny and sepia, of Calypso!!*

<br>

*Narrow legs , as she danced , the sun bends In submission!*

*Behold her once or twice! Nature at its knees!!*

*For nature need not do! A transcient that torture the ascetic minds!*

*Sleek, silky skin, the echoes of her texture, a height of aesthetics!*

<br>

*This beauty is NOT human!*

<br>

*The golden sun crashes her party ! She is yet bioluminescent!*

*Her smile ! A touch of eupathy ! Ravenous! lavishing! Both esurient!*

*She wiggle here, her giggle there! Her gaze changes! we change*

*Men crave the subject of her gaze! Like a known accidence*

*What beauty is this? No! A fluxion of transcendence !*

*To the tune of nature she dance ; by the sonorousness of her charm!*

<br>

*Beauty in the dust ! Her lavender scarf fell to dust!*

*Deep in dust!! A red-carpet to another stage ? Of pulcritide that exceeds flaws!*

*Aphrodite will be jealous ! This is a breakdown of Zeus rage!*
<br>

*Dusk hits earth, red sun and dull sky, her stature still shines bold!*

*More than a thousands Picasso, her's is a bringer of hearty smile!*

*She danced ! Once more ; and my mouth has been opened!*

*Still serves hot, she wrap up to her man!!*

*A kiss of elegance to the face ! I have hoped she Never had a man!!.*
