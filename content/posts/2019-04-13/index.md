*Heathen caven o'er !*

*Heaven caveat , sin at naught ; the message of eden.*

*Hell! Laudable , sad seed shall dwell.*

*Heated cry, worldly earth , FURY of the logos ! Unsheathed!!!*

*Hades call, heaven I want , hell I gain in charades.*

*Hope lost, life of sin, eternal damnation down the rope.*

*Haven of joy! Afar of greatness , the most high is a maven.*

*Hide of the lions burn, the mother of harlots doom, child of Babylon brimstone belied.*

*Heap of joy , cry of sadness in eternity ; earthly work reaps.*

*High in promiscuity, healthy in sins, three score and ten ; the end of a well spent lie.*
