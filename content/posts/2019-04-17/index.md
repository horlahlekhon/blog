excerpt: Smearing artillery of robes , a perfect frame of vivacity!
---

*A distant smell of Anachronism!! A beauty that brings enviable limits to the tides!*

*Have you met a Yoruba woman?*

*Bright Elegance , and blemish free eyes!*

<!--more-->
*You! Say nay; she meta to a leopard! Face the fury of Freya!*

*Have you seen a Yoruba woman!*

*She is morality and modernity in a single layer!*
<br>

*Her charm, of Aphrodite in hologram!*

*Smearing artillery of robes , a perfect frame of vivacity!*

*A desirable surrender ! Of natures virility!*

*A Yoruba woman! A morality ! Her knees filled in tides!*

*As cold, as hot , as elements of a succeeding anagram!*
<br>

*Palindromic in thoughts ! She is her children's mother!*

*Wiggle Ass like an African Rhino ! She is yet a cinosure of men!*

*Marry her! And drink from the river of life! Her husband's goddess , she is platinum!!*

*Court her! And your future is set in stone; as vivid as adamantium !!!*
<br>
