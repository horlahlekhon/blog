*He was sleeping on the floor* \
*I was sitting on a rail*\
*Down by the rail that have no sit*
<!--more-->
*Floor by the state that have no house*\
*Hoisted like to give it all*\
*Hosted on the dusty lane*\
*He weeps even in his sleep*\
*A sorrow of another day to leap*\
*My effects on my back*\
*Like a saddle on a horse*\
*My weep saddling my pupils*\
*Like a girdle round the haste*

<br>

*When would this trowel waters its own*\
*When would this cloud bring the rain*\
*I was sitting by a pass*\
*Complaining how dirty my night was*\
*He was sleeping on the walk*\
*Dirty flannel as a mat*\
*He weeps in his sleep*\
*I was guilty of living more satisfied than him*\
*What is the leader of tomorrow!*\
*Sleeping hopelessly on the walk*\
*When would this stem get strong enough*\
*To make its children climb aback*

<br>

*What am I ?; a man who complained he wasn't loved...*\
*Who is he, a boy, passing through the hard torns*\
*He woke up to the light*\
*As I write this in tears*\
*His arms already burned*\
*My tears couldn't help*\
*I burrowed to the outhouse!*\
*As he borrowed another day!*
